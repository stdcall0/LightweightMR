## Setup  
Python package requirements.  
```
python == 3.9
pytorch == 1.12.1
torch_scatter
trimesh
mcubes
open3d
fpsample
tinycudann  (install via `pip install -e ./tiny-cuda-nn`)
```
In addition, you also need to install some C++ libraries.  
```
Open3D == 0.16
CGAL
boost
libgmp-dev
```

> **Hash encoding dependency**: The SDF/VG networks now rely on [tiny-cuda-nn](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn). Clone it next to this repo and run `pip install -e ./tiny-cuda-nn` (or install the published wheel) before training so that the `tinycudann` Python module is available.

## Compiling
Before starting, you need to compile several C++ programs.  
- Compile a kdtree algorithm for fast querying.
```
cd models/cpplib
conda activate your_env
CC=gcc CXX=gcc python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
- Compile executables to construct Delaunay triangulation and generate the mesh.
```
cd models/delaunay_meshing

cd create_delaunay
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ../
cmake ./
make

cd create_delaunay
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ../
cmake ./
make
```

## Quick Test
There is some data in the `example` folder for reference.  
First, learn the SDF from the point cloud. `example/exp/xxx/SDF` is the output folder.
```
bash scripts/run_sdf.sh
```
Second, generate the mesh from point cloud and learned SDF. `example/exp/xxx/VG` is the output folder. The number of vertices can be specified by the parameter `vertices_size` in `confs/vg.conf`.
```
bash scripts/run_vg.sh
```
